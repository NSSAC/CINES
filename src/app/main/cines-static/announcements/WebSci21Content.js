                            <p>Cyberinfrastructures and gateways are software systems that are accessible by researchers and students for performing wide-ranging computations on data. There are well over 600 gateways, but none is devoted to network science in general. This situation exists despite the fact that much of built infrastructures (e.g., power, water, communications) are networks, and humans form many types of online and face-to-face (social) networks. The myriad computations performed on networks make them a prime candidate for general-purpose computational tools.</p>

                            <Typography className="my-16" variant="h6" component="h6">Who should attend.</Typography>
                            <p>Those generating and analyzing networks. Researchers, students, student-researchers interested in networks and computations on networks. Those working in fields such as engineering, science, social sciences, history, psychology, finance, economics, data science, and mathematics.</p>
